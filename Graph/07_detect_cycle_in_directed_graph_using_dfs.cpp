/** Detecting a cycle in an undirected graph is easy, but when we have a directed graph,
  * then we need to modify the algorithm.
  * We need to check if the cycle is made by traversing in only one direction and not from two sides.
  * Because all the edges here are directed.
  * Hence when we apply DFS here, we keep track of the path we are travelling.
  * We take a visited array and also a dfs_array, which marks the one which we have visited while traversing.
  * When we backtrack after getting a false then we unmark in the dfs_array.
  * This means that we travelled in that direction and didnâ€™t find a cycle.
  * Hence we unmark them in the dfs_array.
  * We find a cycle when an adjacent node of a particular node is visited and it is also in the dfs_array, then we return true.
  * Time and space is the same as DFS.
