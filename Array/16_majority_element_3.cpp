/**
  * Taking the idea from the above problem we can extend it to find majority elements that appear more than n/3 times.
  * In this case, first we need to understand that there will be at most 2 majority elements.
  * So just like we did in the simpler version of the problem,
  * we take two elements as the majority element and maintain their frequency counts and
  * once we find an element that differs from the two, we decrement both the elementsâ€™ counts.
  * In this case we have to look for triplets instead of pairs.
  * This essentially means that we form a triplet out of 2 majority and one non-majority element and remove them from the array.
  * We repeat the process till we consider all array elements and simply verify if the elements we found are correct or not,
  * which can be done in a single pass.
  * Hence this becomes a O(n) time complexity algorithm.
