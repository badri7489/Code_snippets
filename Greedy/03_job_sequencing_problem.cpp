/**
  * Here in this job sequencing problem we need to have maximum profit as well we need to submit the jobs before the deadline.
  * If a jobâ€™s deadline is on a 5th day then we can submit it from day 1 to day 5.
  * Hence To maximize the profit we sort the Job array according to the profit in descending order.
  * Then we take a deadline array of size equal to the max time deadline.
  * Then we traverse the Job array and mark the last date of each job's deadline in the deadline array.
  * If that particular position is taken then we move to the left and check for a vacant place to fit the job.
  * Side by side we also keep a count of the jobs done and the profit made.
  * Time complexity is O(n * log(n)) and space complexity is O(n).
