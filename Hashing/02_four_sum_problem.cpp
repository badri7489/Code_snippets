/**
  * We need to find all the distinct quadruplets which give a target sum.
  * The brute force would be to loop the array 4 times and find them and store them.
  * Then we will at the end try to find all the unique ones and give it as an answer.
  * Better approach would be to loop the array twice and then solve as a two sum question for the right part of the array.
  * We can also take advantage of the situation that the array is sorted to solve the two sum problem.
  * The problem of uniqueness still remains.
  * To solve this, when we are looping over the array we will jump over the values which are repeated.
  * We will do this for i, j, left and right.
  * Hence we wonâ€™t find duplicates in the solution.
  * The time complexity for this would be O(n^3), since we have to loop over the array twice and
  * then once more for finding the two sum problem.
